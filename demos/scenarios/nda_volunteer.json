  "description": "Demonstrates handling of volunteered information where the user provides answers before being asked. Shows IBDM's ability to accommodate unsolicited information and adjust the question sequence.",
  "business_narrative": "This scenario demonstrates IBDM's intelligent handling of 'over-answering' - when users provide more information than requested. Unlike rigid chatbots that ignore extra information, IBDM recognizes and accommodates volunteered facts, avoiding redundant questions. This creates a more natural, efficient dialogue that respects the user's time.",
