# Next Recommended Task

**Date**: 2025-11-16 (Updated - Week 3 Complete!)
**Basis**: IBIS_VARIANTS_PRIORITY.md, IBiS3 end-to-end verified
**Status**: 🎉 Week 3 complete, IBiS3 rule chain verified and working!

---

## ✅ Week 1 Complete: IBiS3 Foundation Implemented!

**Completed** (2025-11-16):
- ✅ Phase separation verified (task plan formation in INTEGRATION phase)
- ✅ `private.issues` field added to PrivateIS
- ✅ Serialization updated (to_dict/from_dict with type safety)
- ✅ Tests written and passing (97/97 core tests)
- ✅ Type checks clean (pyright 0 errors)
- ✅ Committed and pushed: `feat(ibis3): add private.issues field to InformationState`

**Progress**: IBiS3 30% → 35% (foundation infrastructure complete)

---

## ✅ Week 2 Complete: IBiS3 Accommodation Rules Implemented!

**Completed** (2025-11-16):
- ✅ Rule 4.1 (IssueAccommodation) - questions from plans → private.issues
- ✅ Rule 4.2 (LocalQuestionAccommodation) - issues → QUD incrementally
- ✅ Volunteer information handling - check private.issues before QUD
- ✅ Modified _form_task_plan to NOT push to QUD directly
- ✅ Modified _integrate_answer to handle volunteer answers
- ✅ 11 new tests passing, 155 total core tests passing
- ✅ Type checks clean (pyright 0 errors)
- ✅ Committed and pushed: 3 commits implementing Rules 4.1, 4.2, and volunteer info

**Commits**:
- `feat(ibis3): implement Rule 4.1 (IssueAccommodation)`
- `feat(ibis3): implement Rule 4.2 (LocalQuestionAccommodation)`
- `feat(ibis3): handle volunteer information in integrate_answer`

**Progress**: IBiS3 35% → 50% (core accommodation rules working)

**Key Achievement**: Natural dialogue with volunteer information now works!
```
System: "What are the parties?"
User: "Acme and Smith, effective January 1, 2025"
System: [Accommodates date to private.issues, processes as volunteer answer]
System: "What's the governing law?" ← SKIPS ALREADY-ANSWERED QUESTION!
```

## ✅ Week 3 Complete: IBiS3 End-to-End Testing & Bug Fixes!

**Completed** (2025-11-16):
- ✅ Created comprehensive end-to-end integration tests (`test_ibis3_end_to_end.py`)
- ✅ Discovered and fixed 3 critical bugs in rule chain
- ✅ All IBiS3 tests passing (3/3 end-to-end tests)
- ✅ Removed obsolete IBiS1 tests expecting old behavior
- ✅ Verified complete rule chain: Rule 4.1 → Rule 4.2 → SelectAsk

**Bugs Fixed**:
1. **Rule Priority Bug**: form_task_plan now runs BEFORE accommodate_issue_from_plan
2. **Fallback Selection Bug**: Fallback only fires when agenda is empty
3. **Plan Progression Bug**: Removed direct QUD push, Rule 4.2 handles raising

**Commits**:
- `test(ibis3): add end-to-end integration tests for IBiS3 rule chain`
- `fix(ibis3): fix rule priorities and implement incremental questioning`

**Progress**: IBiS3 50% → 60% (rule chain verified and working)

**Key Achievement**: Incremental questioning verified end-to-end!
```
Turn 1:
  - Plan created with 5 questions
  - All 5 questions → private.issues (Rule 4.1)
  - First question → QUD (Rule 4.2)
  - System asks: "What are the parties?"

Turn 2:
  - User answers: "Acme Corp and Smith Inc"
  - Answer integrated, question popped from QUD
  - Next question raised from issues → QUD (Rule 4.2)
  - System asks next question

✅ ONE QUESTION AT A TIME (incremental questioning working!)
```

## 🎯 NEXT PRIORITY: Documentation & Consolidation

**Current Focus**: Week 4 - Document achievements and prepare for next features
**Duration**: 1-2 days
**Blockers**: None - IBiS3 core working!

---

## Week 4 Tasks: Consolidation & Documentation

### Task 1: Update Documentation ⚡ NEXT

**Goal**: Document IBiS3 implementation and update roadmap with lessons learned

**What to Do**:

1. **Update SYSTEM_ACHIEVEMENTS.md**:
   - Document Week 3 completion (IBiS3 rule chain verified)
   - Add section on bugs discovered and fixed
   - Note the importance of rule priority ordering
   - Document incremental questioning achievement

2. **Update LARSSON_PRIORITY_ROADMAP.md**:
   - Mark Rules 4.1 and 4.2 as complete
   - Update IBiS3 progress percentage (60%)
   - Document volunteer information handling
   - Note test coverage improvements

3. **Create IBiS3 implementation guide** (`docs/ibis3_implementation.md`):
   - Overview of Rules 4.1 and 4.2
   - How questions flow: plan → issues → QUD
   - Volunteer information handling
   - Testing approach
   - Common pitfalls (rule priorities, fallback behavior)

**Expected Outcome**:
- Clear documentation of what's been achieved
- Lessons learned captured for future work
- Roadmap updated with accurate progress

---

### Task 2: Prepare for Next Feature (Optional)

**Goal**: Choose and plan next IBiS3 feature to implement

**Options**:
1. **Clarification Questions (Rule 4.3)** - Handle ambiguous utterances
2. **Dependent Issues (Rule 4.4)** - Questions that depend on other questions
3. **Question Reaccommodation (Rule 4.5)** - Re-prioritize unresolved questions

**Recommendation**: Start with clarification questions (Rule 4.3)
- Natural next step after volunteer information
- Complements existing accommodation rules
- Improves dialogue robustness

**What to Do**:
- Review Larsson Section 4.6.3 (clarification)
- Design precondition and effect functions
- Plan test scenarios
- Create task breakdown in NEXT-TASK.md
