- ✅ Rule 4.2 (LocalQuestionAccommodation) - issues → QUD incrementally
- ✅ Volunteer information handling - check private.issues before QUD
- ✅ Modified _form_task_plan to NOT push to QUD directly
- ✅ Modified _integrate_answer to handle volunteer answers
- ✅ 11 new tests passing, 155 total core tests passing
- ✅ Type checks clean (pyright 0 errors)

**Progress**: IBiS3 35% → 50% (core accommodation rules working)

**Key Achievement**: Natural dialogue with volunteer information now works!
```
System: "What are the parties?"
User: "Acme and Smith, effective January 1, 2025"
System: [Accommodates date to private.issues, processes as volunteer answer]
System: "What's the governing law?" ← SKIPS ALREADY-ANSWERED QUESTION!
```

## ✅ Week 3 Complete: IBiS3 End-to-End Testing & Bug Fixes!

**Completed** (2025-11-16):
- ✅ Created comprehensive end-to-end integration tests (`test_ibis3_end_to_end.py`)
- ✅ Discovered and fixed 3 critical bugs in rule chain
- ✅ All IBiS3 tests passing (3/3 end-to-end tests)
- ✅ Removed obsolete IBiS1 tests expecting old behavior
- ✅ Verified complete rule chain: Rule 4.1 → Rule 4.2 → SelectAsk

**Bugs Fixed**:
1. **Rule Priority Bug**: form_task_plan now runs BEFORE accommodate_issue_from_plan
2. **Fallback Selection Bug**: Fallback only fires when agenda is empty
3. **Plan Progression Bug**: Removed direct QUD push, Rule 4.2 handles raising

**Commits**:
- `test(ibis3): add end-to-end integration tests for IBiS3 rule chain`
- `fix(ibis3): fix rule priorities and implement incremental questioning`

**Progress**: IBiS3 50% → 60% (rule chain verified and working)

**Key Achievement**: Incremental questioning verified end-to-end!
```
Turn 1:
  - Plan created with 5 questions
  - All 5 questions → private.issues (Rule 4.1)
  - First question → QUD (Rule 4.2)
  - System asks: "What are the parties?"

Turn 2:
  - User answers: "Acme Corp and Smith Inc"
  - Answer integrated, question popped from QUD
  - Next question raised from issues → QUD (Rule 4.2)
  - System asks next question

✅ ONE QUESTION AT A TIME (incremental questioning working!)
```
